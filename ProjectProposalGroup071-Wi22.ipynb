        "What is considered the stock market is comprised of and measured in what is known as stock market indexes [[1]](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/stock-market-index/). These indexes allow investors the opportunity to track their investmentâ€™s health, and whether a certain stock is on the rise or downfall. These indexes can be composed of several stock types such as agriculture, technology, real estate, and more. The two most popular stock indexes are the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and Standard & Poor's 500 Index (S&P 500) [[2]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/difference-between-dow-jones-industrial-average-and-sp-500/#:~:text=The%20DJIA%20tracks%20the%20stock,the%20stock%20markets%20in%20general.). Each takes measurements of popular company stocks and reports their averages. \n",

        "COVID-19 is a disease that was discovered in December 2019, in Wuhan, China [[3]](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/about-covid-19/basics-covid-19.html). This highly contagious virus spreads through droplets, such as via the mouth and other manners. Symptoms include fever, cough, headache, body aches, and more [[4]](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html). It is recommended that to prevent the spread of the virus wear medical-grade masks when possible that are well-fitted [[5]](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/masks.html). Frequent hand washing and general sanitization of shared and high-touch surfaces are also recommended. Beyond these everyday precautions, the CDC and other government agencies recommended receiving the COVID-19 vaccine (a two-dose system) which lessens the likelihood of death and better helps patients with their symptoms. \n",

        "With this information in mind, to understand how COVID-19 caused a stock market crash in March 2020 is to understand what happened that led to this event. As more cases of COVID-19 were reported in the U.S., and several states and businesses were shutting down in early March, stock investors feared the unknown that was COVID-19 [[6]](https://www.thebalance.com/fundamentals-of-the-2020-market-crash-4799950). States such as California began declaring a state of emergency on March 4th, 2020 [[7]](https://calmatters.org/health/coronavirus/2021/03/timeline-california-pandemic-year-key-points/), followed by New York on March 7, 2020 [[8]]( https://www.investopedia.com/historical-timeline-of-covid-19-in-new-york-city-5071986). Finally, former President Trump declared a national state of emergency on March 13, 2020. Before March 13, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) had already seen a significant point drop. However, three days after the national emergency declaration, March 16, 2020, saw a record low for the DJIA at a 12.93% point fall [[6]](https://www.thebalance.com/fundamentals-of-the-2020-market-crash-4799950). After this, a recession was triggered for the rest of 2020. According to a prior study, stocks such as food, healthcare, and others saw the most positive equity value [[9]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7343658/). On the other end, stocks such as real estate, and entrainment saw low returns [[9]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7343658/). \n",

We will, at every step of the way, ask what biases may exist in the data and our interpretation of the data and take proactive measures to combat dishonest representation. Additionally, we will keep records as our model progresses through version control with Git. Finally, we will be as detailed as possible in the descriptions of our data analysis so that anybody with the same data could reproduce our results. \n",
